A therapist, Theo, stalks the man his wife is cheating on him with, and finds out that man has a wife as well, an artist named Alicia. He watches Alicia for a few days (she's very aware and scared), then one day walks in and ties her up, waits for her husband to come home, ties him up, then forces the husband to choose between his own life or Alicia's. The husband chooses himself, and Theo releases Alicia, who shoots her husband for the betrayal. Theo wants to understand her reasons for killing her husband and makes her his patient, but she recognizes him and he recognizes that she recognizes him and gives her a dose or morphine to induce a coma in her. However, before she falls asleep she writes in her diary everything Theo had done and hides it, for it to be discovered by the cops later.
