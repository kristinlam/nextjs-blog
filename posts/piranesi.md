It's a short, seemingly simple read with an unreliable narrator. Our main character has lost his memory due to the nature of the House, an alternate world that he's been trapped in for the past 6 years. The House is where old ideas from the world go to die. Living harmoniously in a place of giant vestibules, tides, statues, and various animals, Piranesi worships the House for its beauty. A policewoman searches for him, but finds out his friend, The Other, had actually tricked him into coming to this alternate world and trapped him there. The Other is caught in a large flood and dies while trying to shoot at Piranesi and the policewoman. Afterwards, despite the betrayal he has suffered, Piranesi recognizes he has lost his only friend, and agrees to leave with her to try to live life in the real world. This is jarring for him at first, but he comes to realize the beauty of this new world.
